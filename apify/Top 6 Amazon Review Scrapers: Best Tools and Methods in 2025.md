## Legal and Ethical Considerations

### Understanding Amazonâ€™s Terms of Service

Amazon prohibits unauthorized scraping. Violating these terms can result in account suspension or legal consequences. Always weigh the risks and consider legal alternatives like Amazonâ€™s API.

### Ethical Data Collection

Ensure your scraping activities respect user privacy. Even if data is publicly accessible, use it responsibly and avoid misuse.

## Tips for Safe Amazon Review Scraping

### Use Antidetect Browsers

Tools like ScraperAPI and antidetect browsers can help reduce detection risks by mimicking human browsing behavior.

Rotating proxies spread requests across multiple IP addresses, making it harder for Amazon to detect scraping activity.

### Mimic Human Behavior

Introduce random delays, limit request rates, and scrape during non-peak hours to reduce the chances of being flagged.
