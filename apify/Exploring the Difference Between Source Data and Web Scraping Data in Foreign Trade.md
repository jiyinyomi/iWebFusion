## What is Source Data?

Source data refers to authentic and comprehensive data obtained directly from official or primary sources. This type of data is generally provided by credible organizations, platforms, or systems, ensuring high reliability.

### Key Characteristics of Source Data

- **Authoritative Origin**: Source data is often derived from official databases, government institutions, trade associations, or internal corporate systems, such as customs data, government export-import records, or company financial data.
- **High Data Quality**: It is accurate, complete, and typically verified or audited, making it highly reliable for business decision-making.
- **Legal Acquisition**: Obtained through subscriptions, purchases, or partnerships with authorized entities, ensuring compliance with relevant laws and regulations.
- **Real-Time and Updated**: Regular updates ensure timely access to market changes based on partnership agreements.

### Advantages of Source Data

- High accuracy, suitable for critical decision-making.
- Trusted origin ensures high credibility.
- Structured and complete data, ready for analysis and application.

### Disadvantages of Source Data

- May require significant investment to access.
- Limited data scope, particularly for niche or smaller markets.

### Application Scenarios

1. **International Trade Analysis**: Use customs data to analyze market trends and identify potential clients.
2. **Internal Business Optimization**: Manage supply chains or customer relationships using enterprise-level source data.

## What is Web Scraping Data?

Web scraping data is collected through automated tools, known as web crawlers, from publicly available online sources. These tools systematically extract information from websites to build datasets.

### Key Characteristics of Web Scraping Data

- **Diverse Sources**: Data is collected from various publicly accessible platforms, such as social media, B2B platforms, industry websites, company websites, and forums.
- **Inconsistent Data Quality**: Accuracy and completeness may vary depending on the source, with some data being redundant, inaccurate, or incomplete.
- **Legal Risks**: Depending on regional laws, unauthorized scraping may violate website terms or trigger legal challenges.
- **Lower Real-Time Accuracy**: Since scraping relies on scheduled crawls, the data may not reflect the latest updates, especially for frequently changing websites.

### Advantages of Web Scraping Data

- Large-scale data collection from multiple public sources.
- High automation saves time and labor costs.
- Ability to gather unstructured market insights, such as trends and industry intelligence.

### Disadvantages of Web Scraping Data

- Requires cleaning and preprocessing to improve quality.
- Legal compliance is complex, especially in regions with strict privacy regulations.
- Data availability may be affected by website changes or access restrictions.

### Application Scenarios

1. **Market Intelligence Gathering**: Collect competitor information, industry news, and market updates from public platforms.
2. **B2B Data Collection**: Extract product details, pricing, and reviews from B2B platforms for analysis.
3. **Lead Generation**: Scrape public contact details and company information to develop potential clients.
