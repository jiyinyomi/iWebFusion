## Setting Up Your Scraping Environment

### 1. Install Necessary Tools

To scrape Walmart reviews, you'll need:
- A code editor to write your script.
- Libraries like `cheerio` for parsing HTML and `fs` for handling files.

### 2. Write the Scraping Script

Create a JavaScript file (e.g., `walmart-scraper.js`). Your script should include:
- Loading the Walmart product page.
- Extracting reviews, ratings, and other key data.

Hereâ€™s a basic example of a script to scrape Walmart reviews:
```javascript
const cheerio = require('cheerio');
const fs = require('fs');

const walmartHtmlFile = 'walmart-product.html';

function scrapeReviews(filePath) {
    try {
        const html = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf-8');
        const $ = cheerio.load(html);
        const reviews = [];

        $('#item-review-section li').each((index, element) => {
            const rating = $(element).find('.rating-stars').text().trim();
            const reviewText = $(element).find('.review-text').text().trim();
            
            if (rating && reviewText) {
                reviews.push({ rating, review: reviewText });
            }
        });

        fs.writeFileSync('walmart-reviews.json', JSON.stringify(reviews, null, 2));
        console.log('Reviews saved to walmart-reviews.json');
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error:', error);
    }
}
