# Recommended Web Scraping Tool: Web Scraper

Web Scraper is a powerful Chrome extension that allows you to extract data directly from web pages. In essence, **it can serve as a simplified web scraping tool** without requiring programming knowledge.

Whether you're conducting research, organizing data, or creating structured datasets, Web Scraper can boost your efficiency. I recently used it to extract valuable data from the "Xiniu Data" website for a tagging project, and it worked flawlessly. Below, I'll walk you through its features and show how I used it effectively.

## What is Web Scraper?

Web Scraper is a **visual web element parser** built into Chrome. By selecting elements on a page, you can extract the data you need. This makes it a great alternative to programming-based scraping tools, especially for simpler tasks.

### How Does It Compare to Coding-Based Web Scraping?

Using Web Scraper is like training a robot to simulate clicks and extract specific elements. You define the target elements, and the tool automates the process. Traditional scraping with Python, on the other hand, involves downloading an entire webpage and using code to parse HTML, which offers more flexibility but requires programming skills.

For basic page data extraction, Web Scraper is easier and faster. If you're new to web scraping, this tool is an excellent starting point.

## How to Use Web Scraper

### Step 1: Create a Sitemap

1. Open Chrome and press `F12` to open the Developer Tools.
2. Locate the **Web Scraper** tab and click **Create Sitemap**.
3. Enter the target websiteâ€™s URL and give your scraping task a name. For example:
   - **Name**: `xiniulevel`
   - **URL**: `http://www.example.com/industry/level`

### Step 2: Add Scraping Selectors

For my project, I needed to extract primary and secondary tags. Hereâ€™s how I set it up:

1. Navigate to the newly created sitemap and click **Add New Selector**.
2. Use the **Select** button to choose the target elements. Hover over elements to highlight them in green and click to select them. The selected area will turn red.
3. If multiple elements share the same structure, continue selecting adjacent elements. Web Scraper will group them automatically.

4. Ensure the **Multiple** checkbox is selected to indicate you're extracting multiple elements. Save your selector when done.

### Step 3: Preview and Export Data

After creating selectors, return to the main screen. Youâ€™ll see a list of selectors youâ€™ve created.

1. Click **Data Preview** in the Actions column to see the extracted data.
2. Copy the data from the preview window and paste it into Excel or other tools.

For example, I extracted both primary and secondary tags and pasted the results directly into my Excel sheet for further processing. It was simple, fast, and effective.
