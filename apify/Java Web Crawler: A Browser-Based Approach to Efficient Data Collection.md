# Java Web Crawler: A Browser-Based Approach to Efficient Data Collection

The internet is an ever-expanding treasure trove of data. From conducting business analyses to training neural networks, the need to extract and analyze web data has become crucial. This process, however, must be fast and efficient.

## Why Collect and Analyze Web Data?

Web data collection can serve a wide range of purposes, including:

- Conducting website audits.
- Aggregating data from online stores.
- Preparing training datasets for machine learning.
- Monitoring social media reviews, news feeds, and blogs.
- Analyzing website content, such as identifying broken links.

The data extracted isnâ€™t limited to text; it can also include images, videos, tables, and other multimedia elements. Additionally, tasks such as extracting links, searching by keywords, and monitoring a websiteâ€™s health (e.g., detecting dead links) often require specialized tools.

## Existing Solutions for Data Extraction

The traditional approach to collecting and analyzing web data involves sending requests to a web server and processing the HTML response. However, this method falls short for modern websites that heavily rely on JavaScript to dynamically generate content. A simple HTML response may only provide a basic framework, with key data loaded or rendered dynamically through JavaScript execution.

## Leveraging Web Browsers for Web Scraping

> Websites are built for people, and people access them via web browsers.

Using a web browser to collect data bypasses many limitations of traditional approaches. For instance, websites requiring login or actions such as clicking links can be better handled by a browser. Additionally, using a browser allows control over user-agent settings, ensuring the server doesnâ€™t flag you as a bot and serving you the desired content.

This article explores a browser-based approach to web scraping, focusing on collecting all links from a specified website and identifying broken links. This can be achieved using the **Chromium** browser through the [JxBrowser](https://bit.ly/Scraperapi) library.

## The JxBrowser Library: A Powerful Solution for Java Applications

[JxBrowser](https://bit.ly/Scraperapi) is a commercial Java library that enables the use of Chromiumâ€™s capabilities in Java applications. It is particularly helpful for companies needing advanced web scraping solutions for internal or commercial software products.

### Key Features:
- Full Chromium browser integration for Java.
- Advanced web scraping and automation capabilities.
- Reliable DOM access for analyzing web pages.

## Setting Up the Java Web Crawler

Before developing a browser-based crawler, there are several factors to consider:

1. **Starting Point:** Decide whether to begin from the homepage or a specific webpage.
2. **Link Types:** Differentiate between internal, external, and anchor links (`#`).
3. **Circular Links:** Implement logic to handle circular references.
4. **Error Handling:** Detect broken links and capture error codes.
5. **Performance:** Use timeouts to avoid overloading web servers.

With these considerations, the crawler workflow would look like this:

1. Launch the browser.
2. Load the target webpage.
3. Extract all links from the pageâ€™s DOM.
4. Handle errors if the page fails to load.
5. Save the processed page to avoid re-analysis.
6. Filter out irrelevant links (e.g., `mailto:` or anchor links).
7. Recursively process links from the same domain.
8. Skip external links after recording them.
9. Once all pages are processed, close the browser.
10. Analyze the results to identify broken links.

## Implementation Example: Using JxBrowser

The following code demonstrates a Java-based implementation of a web crawler using the JxBrowser library:

```java
package com.teamdev.jxbrowser.examples.webcrawler;

import static com.google.common.base.Preconditions.checkNotNull;
import static com.teamdev.jxbrowser.engine.RenderingMode.OFF_SCREEN;

import com.google.common.collect.ImmutableSet;
import com.teamdev.jxbrowser.browser.Browser;
import com.teamdev.jxbrowser.engine.Engine;
import com.teamdev.jxbrowser.engine.EngineOptions;
import java.io.Closeable;
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Optional;
import java.util.Set;

/**
 * A web crawler implementation based on JxBrowser.
 * It discovers and analyzes web pages, accessing their DOM content and detecting broken links.
 */
public final class WebCrawler implements Closeable {

    public static WebCrawler newInstance(String url, WebPageFactory factory) {
        return new WebCrawler(url, factory);
    }

    private final Engine engine;
    private final Browser browser;
    private final String targetUrl;
    private final Set<WebPage> pages;
    private final WebPageFactory pageFactory;

    private WebCrawler(String url, WebPageFactory factory) {
        checkNotNull(url);
        checkNotNull(factory);

        targetUrl = url;
        pageFactory = factory;
        pages = new HashSet<>();

        engine = Engine.newInstance(
                EngineOptions.newBuilder(OFF_SCREEN)
                        .enableIncognito()
                        .build());
        browser = engine.newBrowser();
    }

    public void start(WebCrawlerListener listener) {
        checkNotNull(listener);
        analyze(targetUrl, pageFactory, listener);
    }

    private void analyze(String url, WebPageFactory factory, WebCrawlerListener listener) {
        if (!isVisited(url)) {
            WebPage webPage = factory.create(browser, url);
            pages.add(webPage);

            listener.webPageVisited(webPage);

            if (url.startsWith(targetUrl)) {
                webPage.links().forEach(
                        link -> analyze(link.url(), factory, listener));
            }
        }
    }

    private boolean isVisited(String url) {
        checkNotNull(url);
        return page(url).orElse(null) != null;
    }

    public ImmutableSet<WebPage> pages() {
        return ImmutableSet.copyOf(pages);
    }

    public Optional<WebPage> page(String url) {
        checkNotNull(url);
        for (WebPage page : pages) {
            if (page.url().equals(url)) {
                return Optional.of(page);
            }
        }
        return Optional.empty();
    }

    @Override
    public void close() {
        engine.close();
    }
}
```

## Challenges and Solutions

### Common Issues:
1. **DDoS Protection:** Frequent requests may trigger anti-DDoS mechanisms. Implement timeouts to reduce the load.
2. **Redirects:** Handle redirects by tracking both the requested and final URLs.
3. **Timeouts:** Mark pages as unavailable if they fail to load within a specified time.
4. **Dynamic DOM Changes:** Account for DOM elements that may change post-load.

The browserâ€™s capabilities can address most of these challenges, ensuring a robust web scraping solution.
