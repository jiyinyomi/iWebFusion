## How to Scrape Amazon Search Results Using Apify

Apify is a web scraping and automation platform designed to make scraping more accessible. Hereâ€™s how to scrape Amazon search results using **Apify**.

### Step 1: Setting Up the Environment

First, install Apify's CLI tool and scaffold your scraper project:

```bash
npm install -g apify-cli
apify create --template=puppeteer amazon-scraper
cd amazon-scraper
```

This command will create a project folder with all necessary files. Open `main.js` and replace the default code with the following starting code:

```javascript
const Apify = require('apify');

Apify.main(async () => {
  const input = await Apify.getValue('INPUT');
  if (!input || !input.keyword) throw new Error('INPUT must contain a keyword!');
  
  console.log('Launching Puppeteer...');
  const browser = await Apify.launchPuppeteer();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  
  console.log(`Searching for keyword: ${input.keyword}`);
  await page.goto(`https://www.amazon.com/s?k=${input.keyword}`);
  
  const title = await page.title();
  console.log(`Page title: "${title}"`);
  
  await browser.close();
  console.log('Scraping complete.');
});
```

### Step 2: Providing Input for the Scraper

Edit the input file `INPUT.json` to include the keyword you wish to scrape. For example:

```json
{
  "keyword": "garlic press"
}
```

Using an exclamation mark (`!`) in the search query forces Amazon to display results in a one-product-per-row format, making the scraping process more predictable.

### Step 3: Running the Scraper

Run your scraper locally:

```bash
apify run
```

This will scrape the search results page and output the page title to the console.

## Enhancing the Scraper: Extracting Product Details

The initial scraper only captures the search results page. To extract detailed product information, such as pricing and product descriptions, youâ€™ll need to modify the code to include a **request queue**.

```javascript
const Apify = require('apify');

Apify.main(async () => {
  const input = await Apify.getValue('INPUT');
  if (!input || !input.keyword) throw new Error('INPUT must contain a keyword!');

  const browser = await Apify.launchPuppeteer();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto(`https://www.amazon.com/s?k=${input.keyword}`);

  const requestQueue = await Apify.openRequestQueue();
  await Apify.utils.enqueueLinks({
    page,
    selector: '.s-main-slot a',
    pseudoUrls: [new Apify.PseudoUrl('https://www.amazon.com/[*]')],
    requestQueue,
  });

  const crawler = new Apify.PuppeteerCrawler({
    requestQueue,
    handlePageFunction: async ({ request, page }) => {
      const title = await page.title();
      const price = await page.$eval('.a-price .a-offscreen', el => el.textContent.trim());
      console.log({ title, price, url: request.url });
      await Apify.pushData({ title, price, url: request.url });
    },
  });

  await crawler.run();
  await browser.close();
});
```

### Benefits of Using a Request Queue

- **Concurrency**: The scraper processes multiple requests simultaneously, speeding up the scraping process.
- **State Management**: If the scraper is interrupted, it resumes from where it left off.
- **Throttling**: Prevents overloading Amazon's servers.

Run the scraper again using:

```bash
apify run
```
